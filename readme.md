# NotesMVC App Template

Starting point to create a NotesMVC app using your JS framework of choice. The app is designed to be a clone of the default Mac Notes app. The app should function as follows:

* The list of notes should be displayed in the left column, sorted by timestamp (newest on top)
* Each note in the list should display a title (based on the content of the note) and a timestamp underneath
* Clicking on a note in the list will highlight it in the list and display the full contents in the editor in the right column
* Editing the active note will dynamically update the left column list (title, timestamp, sorting)
* Clicking the "New" button will create a new note with empty text
* Clicking the "Delete" button will delete the active note
* Entering text in the "Search" input will dynamically filter the list of notes

This template provides all the necessary HTML and CSS to get started, with an empty JS file to use as a starting point.

Note that the editor is an HTML textarea tag, which means there isn't any rich text editing capabilities. This can be optionally swapped with a WYSIWYG editor to add other text formatting features.
